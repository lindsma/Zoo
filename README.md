# Zoo

## Week 3 

#### Objective:
Create a Zoo. The zoo has lots of different animals, many of which share various properties and actions. We will have a base Animal with some shared functionality, then a few species of animals with specific functionality. 

* Create an Animal constructor
 * Animals have a name and date of birth
 * Animals should have a method for determining their age in years
* Create a few species (2 minimum) which inherit from Animal
 * If you create a mammal, it must be able to give birth (what would giving birth return?)
 * If you create a reptile or bird it must be able to lay one or more eggs
 * For each species create at least one other method (in addition to the things directly above)
 * For example, parrots can speak, lions can roar, otters can swim, etc...
 * Your species-specific method(s) should take at least one argument. For example, a swim method might take the argument: duration and return how far the animal swam in that time (speed * time).
 * ALL species must re-implement the toString() method, which is first defined on the Object prototype.
* Write tests for your Zoo!
 * This is how we know our code is working, and how we can create our various Animals without having a web application yet.
 * Make sure you can create each type of animal species
 * Make sure the animals you create have the correct data on them
